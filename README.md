# JARVIS
A system for creating, training, displaying and testing neural networks on the web browser. Currently fully supports [multilayer perceptron networks (MLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron) and supports partially [long short-term memory networks (LSTM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory).

Networks are created and used with [SynapticJS](https://github.com/cazala/synaptic) and displayed with [D3JS](https://d3js.org/).
